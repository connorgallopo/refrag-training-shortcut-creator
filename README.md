# Refrag Shortcut Creation Tool
This is a small repo that contains a user-runnable script to create a shortcut to launch CS2 with the appropriate launch options for [Refrag.gg](https://refrag.gg/)

It will produce a Shortcut on your desktop that launches CS2 with the launch options `-insecure -dev +sv_cheats 1`

## Instructions
1. Click [here](https://github.com/connorgallopo/refrag-training-shortcut-creator/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) OR the green `Code` in the top right, then `Download ZIP`
2. Unzip the folder
3. Right click `CreateRefragLauncher.ps1` and select `Run with PowerShell`
4. The shortcut should automatically show on your desktop!

## Notes
- This requires Steam to be running, if Steam is not running it will not work because it uses the running process to find where Steam is installed. This is so that it works for everyone no matter where it's installed.
